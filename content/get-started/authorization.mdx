# Authorization

We already described how to generate your API key in the <Link href="/get-started">getting started</Link> chapter.

After you've done that, you are ready to authenticate your requests made to the API.

## Request authorization

We have adopted for the traditional `Bearer <key>` scheme for authenticating your requests.

In your `Headers` simply add:

```
{
  "authorization": "Bearer <Your key>"
}
```

And you should be good to go 🙌
