# Starter Template

The remoet.dev portfolio starter template is a minimal, static portfolio site built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.
It fetches your data from the remoet.dev API at build time, so your API key is never exposed to the client.

## Features

- Server-side data fetching
- Light and dark mode toggle
- Responsive single-page layout
- Sections: Hero, Experience, Projects, Education
- Clean design with Geist fonts
- Built with Tailwind CSS

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the template

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd starter-template
yarn install
```

### 2. Add your API key

Create a `.env.local` file:

```
REMOET_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

You can generate an API key at [remoet.dev/profile/api](https://remoet.dev/profile/api).

### 3. Run locally

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your portfolio.

### 4. Deploy

Deploy to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and add `REMOET_API_KEY` as an environment variable in your project settings.

## What data is displayed?

The template uses the `GET /user/full` endpoint which returns:

- **Profile** — name, avatar, summary, location, social links
- **Experience** — work history with company, role, technologies, dates
- **Projects** — project cards with description, tech stack, repo/demo links
- **Education** — institution, degree, field of study, dates

## Customization

### Colors

Edit the CSS variables in `app/globals.css` to change the color scheme for both light and dark modes.

### Layout

Modify section order or add/remove sections in `app/page.tsx`.

### Components

All components are in `app/components/`. Reusable UI primitives (badges, tags, date formatting) are in `app/components/ui/`.

## API Endpoint

The template calls a single endpoint:

```
GET https://www.api.remoet.dev/user/full
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

Data is revalidated every hour (`revalidate: 3600`). You can adjust this in `lib/api.ts`.
