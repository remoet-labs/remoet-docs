# Get Started

## Create a developer profile

The first thing you need to do is create a developer profile at [remoet.dev](https://remoet.dev).
You will need a Github account to sign up.

## Generate your API Key

When you have created your developer profile, nagivate to your API keys at [remoet.dev/profile/api](https://remoet.dev/profile/api)
There you can generate up to 5 API Keys. 

Each Key allows you to make 1000 requests a month.
