# Introduction
 
Welcome to remoet.dev developer documentation!

## What is remoet.dev?

remoet.dev is a project on a mission to connect global tech talent with global tech companies.

If you have stumbled onto this page randomly, we suggest you to give us a visit at our main site [remoet.dev](https://remoet.dev)

## What is remoet.dev API

The public facing developer `API` is a set of `REST` `API`s for users on [remoet.dev](https://remoet.dev) to 
access their data programatically.

For instance when developers are building their own portfolio site [remoet.dev](https://remoet.dev) can act as a single source of 
truth for their career related information. 

## Why?

We are developers and we are building [remoet.dev](https://remoet.dev) for developers. That means we won't gatekeep your data.
It shall be fully accessible to you and you can go off and build freely with that data. That's our philosophy and it's a shame 
other platforms does not let you do this.
